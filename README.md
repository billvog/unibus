# Unibus

An application created to help people in Lamia, where I attend UNI, and later all Greece, find buses and move around the city with ease.

## Features

- 🗺️ Map with bus stops.
- 📍 Geolocation Web API, to help you pick a stop near you.
- ✨ Great UI/UX (far better than [citybus.gr](https://lamia.citybus.gr/el/stops)).
- 🔔 Notifications, to never miss a bus ever again.
